As a Principle Software Engineer at JPMorganChase within the Global Technology - Analytics, Insights and Measurements (GT AIM) team, you will deliver trusted, decision-grade insight across GT through rigorous statistical analysis and domain-informed interpretation. You will be entrusted in delivering market-leading technology products in a secure, stable, and scalable way. As a core technical contributor, you are responsible for conducting critical technology solutions across multiple technical areas within various business functions in support of the firm’s business objectives.

Reporting to the Head of GT Architecture and Strategy (GTAS), this role applies sound statistical and analytical methods to technology data to inform strategy, execution, and investment decisions across multiple technology domains. The role works in close partnership with leaders of strategic programs, providing continuous statistical analysis and insight to support priority outcomes.

The role requires deep understanding of software engineering delivery models and flows e.g., feature branch, trunk-based, and integrated delivery to ensure metrics and analysis accurately reflect how technology is delivered. Areas of focus include developer productivity, delivery and portfolio performance, technology spend and value realization, return on investment, and the adoption and impact of Artificial Intelligence across GT.

The emphasis is on building internally owned, transparent, and explainable analytics through sound statistical methods, rather than relying on opaque third-party tools. All roles are hands-on. Managers provide leadership and direction while actively contributing to analysis and insight delivery. Senior Individual Contributors independently own complex analytical problems and influence outcomes through expertise and insight.

We have an opportunity to impact your career and provide an adventure where you can push the limits of what's possible.

Statistical Analysis and Data Interpretation
• Continuously refine analytical approaches as technology strategy, architecture, and delivery practices evolve. Support technology leadership in understanding trade-offs, risks, opportunities, and uncertainty.
• Conclusions provided must be sound, statistically and contextually valid and based on actual engineering and business ecosystems. Collaborate closely with engineering, platform, architecture, and AI enablement teams to understand delivery practices, workflows and constraints
• Perform hands-on statistical analysis using appropriate descriptive, inferential, and exploratory techniques. Apply those techniques and reasoning to assess variability, confidence, uncertainty, statistical significance, and margin of error where appropriate.
• Evaluate distributions, trends, and changes over time while accounting for structural differences in teams, systems, and delivery models. Be able to distinguish correlation from causation and clearly communicate analytical limitations, assumptions, and confidence levels.

Operations, Measurements and Instrumentation
• Identify required data points needed to answer key analytical and statistical questions, then define requirements for instrumenting data at the source.
• Ensure metrics are compatible with different engineering flows, including feature branch development, trunk-based development, and integrated delivery.

BRIEF BREW HISTORY

Morning Brew Inc. was founded in 2015 by two entrepreneurial college students who noticed their peers were not consuming legacy media resources about business and finance news, but had a high desire to learn about those topics. What started as a small on-campus email has since evolved into a multi-channel media company that operates 20+ unique content franchises. All while maintaining our witty, honest and engaging tone that millions of loyal MBI audience members rely upon daily to better navigate the world.

In 2020 a majority stake in MBI was acquired by Axel Springer SE and in February 2025 that position was increased to full ownership of the business. Axel Springer SE is a family-owned, transatlantic media company headquartered in Berlin and New York that is committed to the values of a free and informed society.

We are hiring an AI Analytics Engineer to lead the build-out of data infrastructure and intelligent systems across Havenly Brands. This is a highly strategic role that sits at the intersection of analytics engineering, data engineering, and AI development, focused on evolving our data practice for an AI-first world.

You will partner with business leaders to design, build, and implement end-to-end data solutions. Your technical focus will span from foundational data pipelines and semantic layers-requiring expert proficiency in data processing, analysis, SQL, and dbt-to architecting systems optimized for AI consumption.

Crucially, you will build data interfaces that allow AI agents to reliably query business information. This involves leveraging tools like MCP (Model Context Protocol servers), LLM context windows, and internal applications to enable fast, conversational access to a single source of truth, moving beyond traditional dashboards. You will translate business strategy into measurable data outcomes and report to the SVP of Product and Technology.

What You'll Do

Consult and Partner with the Business
• Collaborate directly with business leaders to understand strategy, operations, and the outcomes they're trying to achieve-not just the data they think they need
• Design analytical approaches and measurement frameworks that directly target business goals, going beyond data modeling to the end analysis and action
• Lead measurement implementation strategy: determine what data we should collect, can collect, and how to instrument new touchpoints to answer emerging questions
• Translate business problems into data solutions, and data insights back into business recommendations

Build and Maintain Data Infrastructure
• Extract data from disparate sources into a centralized cloud data warehouse
• Design and implement data pipelines that ensure reliability, correctness, and freshness
• Build and maintain transformations and semantic layers that accurately model business operations across our portfolio of brands
• Implement data quality monitoring, testing, and observability across all data assets

Enable AI-First Data Access
• Architect data systems optimized for AI agent consumption, not just traditional BI tools
• Build and configure semantic layers, MCPs (Model Context Protocol servers), and interfaces that allow AI systems to reliably query and understand our data
• Create governed, well-documented metrics and dimensions that serve as a single source of truth for both humans and AI systems
• Develop tools and context that empower internal AI agents and interactive AI applications Drive Intelligence & Automation
• Drive strategy and implementation of consumer touchpoint data collection to power internal intelligence and cross-brand marketing activation
• Identify opportunities to automate operations with AI and data processing-then build the solutions
• Build internal tools and applications that leverage AI capabilities to serve the organization
• Help uplevel the entire organization's data capabilities and AI fluency

Who You Are

Experience & Skills
• 3-5+ years of experience in analytics engineering, data engineering, or a related field working with business stakeholders
• Expert SQL skills with experience writing complex transformations, data models, and analytical queries
• Strong Python proficiency for data processing, automation, and building tools
• Modern data stack experience: dbt (strongly preferred), cloud warehouses (Snowflake, BigQuery, or similar), and ETL/orchestration tools (Airbyte, Fivetran, Airflow, or similar)
• AI-native workflow: You actively use AI tools (Claude Code, Cursor, or similar) to accelerate your work-and you're excited to push further
• Business acumen: Track record of partnering with stakeholders to understand requirements, design solutions, and deliver measurable outcomes

Mindset & Approach
• Business-obsessed: You think beyond data models to the analysis, operation, and end goal-you care about outcomes, not just deliverables
• Strategic thinking: You see the big picture-connecting data capabilities to business strategy, short-term wins to long-term vision
• Proactive and curious: You identify opportunities before being asked and stay ahead of emerging technologies
• Clear communicator: You can translate between technical and business contexts, articulating the ""why""; in terms that resonate across disciplines
• Quality-obsessed: You care deeply about data correctness, documentation, and reliability
• Ownership mentality: You take initiative, navigate ambiguity, and see problems through to outcomes

Bonus Points
• Experience building internal tools or applications (web apps, automations, AI-powered features)
• Direct experience architecting data for AI consumption (e.g. semantic layers, MCPs, RAG-optimized systems) or with with AI agent frameworks
• Background in machine learning model development or deployment
• Experience with consumer/marketing data, customer data platforms, or marketing activation
• Experience with Vibe Coding/Agentic Engineering-you've enjoyed building with AI, and you can't stop thinking about it

Why Havenly Brands
• Impact at scale: Your work will power how millions of people discover, design, and furnish their homes
• AI at the core: We're building the next generation of AI-powered tools-you'll shape how data enables intelligent experiences
• Business partnership: This isn't a back-office data role-you'll work directly with leaders to drive strategy and outcomes
• Multi-brand portfolio: Work across diverse consumer experiences-from AI design services to artisan home goods

Anthropic’s mission is to create reliable, interpretable, and steerable AI systems. We want AI to be safe and beneficial for our users and for society as a whole. Our team is a quickly growing group of committed researchers, engineers, policy experts, and business leaders working together to build beneficial AI systems.

About The Role

As a member of the Compute team, you will play a critical role in Anthropic's mission of building safe and beneficial AI by ensuring we understand, optimize, and strategically manage our cloud infrastructure spend. Your work will directly impact how efficiently we operate our multi-cloud and datacenter footprint, from forecasting infrastructure needs and planning capacity, to driving utilization improvements and reducing unit costs across our compute, storage, and networking resources.

You will work closely with Compute Finance, Infrastructure Engineers, and Product to translate raw cloud billing data into actionable efficiency insights and influence capacity planning & allocation. You will help build deep visibility into our infrastructure spend, forecast capacity needs, attribute costs accurately across teams and workloads, model resource demand curves, and help identify efficiency opportunities across our fleet. You've worked in cultures of excellence and are eager to bring analytical rigor and operational impact to a company scaling its infrastructure at an extraordinary pace.

Responsibilities
• Build and maintain cloud cost attribution models that accurately allocate infrastructure spend (compute, accelerators, storage, networking, data transfer) across teams, products, and workloads, providing clear visibility into who is spending what and why.
• Build and maintain cost of revenue pipelines and models
• Partner with infrastructure, finance, and procurement stakeholders to analyze utilization patterns, identify inefficiencies, and drive optimization initiatives that improve the cost-effectiveness of our non-accelerator cloud resources.
• Develop forecasting models for non-accelerator infrastructure demand, incorporating business growth projections, product roadmaps, and historical spend trends to enable proactive capacity planning and budget accuracy.
• Define and track unit cost metrics (e.g., cost per request, cost per GB stored, cost per pipeline run) and identify opportunities to reduce them, influencing infrastructure and engineering roadmaps with data-driven recommendations.
• Develop unit cost economics for various workloads and applications, and using the metrics to drive efficiency efforts across product and infrastructure teams.
• Build a cost-aware culture across the organization by creating self-serve dashboards, automated reporting, and accessible datasets that give engineering and finance teams clear visibility into cloud spend and efficiency metrics.

Annual Salary

$275,000—$370,000 USD

Logistics

Education requirements: We require at least a Bachelor's degree in a related field or equivalent experience.

Location-based hybrid policy: Currently, we expect all staff to be in one of our offices at least 25% of the time. However, some roles may require more time in our offices.

Visa sponsorship: We do sponsor visas! However, we aren't able to successfully sponsor visas for every role and every candidate. But if we make you an offer, we will make every reasonable effort to get you a visa, and we retain an immigration lawyer to help with this.

We encourage you to apply even if you do not believe you meet every single qualification. Not all strong candidates will meet every single qualification as listed. Research shows that people who identify as being from underrepresented groups are more prone to experiencing imposter syndrome and doubting the strength of their candidacy, so we urge you not to exclude yourself prematurely and to submit an application if you're interested in this work. We think AI systems like the ones we're building have enormous social and ethical implications. We think this makes representation even more important, and we strive to include a range of diverse perspectives on our team.

Your safety matters to us. To protect yourself from potential scams, remember that Anthropic recruiters only contact you from @anthropic.com email addresses. In some cases, we may partner with vetted recruiting agencies who will identify themselves as working on behalf of Anthropic. Be cautious of emails from other domains. Legitimate Anthropic recruiters will never ask for money, fees, or banking information before your first day. If you're ever unsure about a communication, don't click any links—visit anthropic.com/careers directly for confirmed position openings.

How We're Different

We believe that the highest-impact AI research will be big science. At Anthropic we work as a single cohesive team on just a few large-scale research efforts. And we value impact — advancing our long-term goals of steerable, trustworthy AI — rather than work on smaller and more specific puzzles. We view AI research as an empirical science, which has as much in common with physics and biology as with traditional efforts in computer science. We're an extremely collaborative group, and we host frequent research discussions to ensure that we are pursuing the highest-impact work at any given time. As such, we greatly value communication skills.

The easiest way to understand our research directions is to read our recent research. This research continues many of the directions our team worked on prior to Anthropic, including: GPT-3, Circuit-Based Interpretability, Multimodal Neurons, Scaling Laws, AI & Compute, Concrete Problems in AI Safety, and Learning from Human Preferences.

• Plug into an existing large, production-level codebase, contributing clean, tested, modular code.
• Leverage AWS components (e.g., S3, Lambda, Glue, Step Functions) to orchestrate end-to-end workflows.
• Write Python scripts and utilities (pandas, polars, numpy) to automate data validation, ingestion, and reporting processes.

3. dbt & Transformation Layer
• Implement and refine dbt models to transform raw data into analytics-ready structures.
• Define and enforce data testing, lineage tracking, and documentation through dbt best practices.
• Integrate dbt with CI/CD pipelines for automated testing and deployment.
• Collaborate with analysts to expose dbt-modeled data directly to Tableau and other BI tools.

4. Analytics & Dashboard Workflow Support
• Support Tableau dashboard workflows, maintaining and optimizing data sources and extracts.
• Work cross-functionally with analysts and business users to ensure data freshness and performance.
• Enhance self-service analytics by ensuring governed, well-modeled data sources.

5. Cross-Team Collaboration & Knowledge Transfer
• Participate in knowledge transfer (approximately one month) with existing team members to understand architecture, pipelines, and operational processes.
• Work collaboratively with internal engineering, data science, and business analytics teams.
• Deliver thorough documentation and ensure smooth handoff post-engagement.

Technical Environment
Data Warehouse:
• Snowflake (core platform; advanced optimization expected)

Programming / Scripting:
• Python (data pipelines, automation, ETL orchestration)
• Libraries: pandas, polars, numpy

Data Transformation:
• dbt (data build tool) — model development, testing, documentation

The Finance Data team is embedded within the CFO Org and is responsible for building internal data products that scale analytics across business teams and drive efficiencies in our daily operations. This team provides technical guidance on high-impact, scalable projects across Finance, and is the subject-matter expert in financial and transactional data that supports our Finance day-to-day operations.

About the Role

As an Analytics Engineer, you will be setting the foundation to scale analytics across our business functions and impart best data practices for a rapidly growing organization. We aspire to build the Finance team of the future.

In addition, you will work collaboratively with key stakeholders in Finance and other business teams to understand their pain points and take the lead in proposing viable, future-proof solutions to resolve them. You will also autonomously lead your own projects that deliver business impact and help cultivate a mature data culture among Finance teams.

We are looking for a seasoned engineer who has a proven track record of owning the entire data stack at high transaction volume companies, managing business critical ETL pipelines consumed by non-technical teams. As a generalist “fixer”, you may be deployed across several different Finance domains (e.g. Tax datamart, ERP migration, Procurement automation). For this role we need someone who excels in dynamic environments, adapts quickly to changing needs, and confidently navigates ambiguous or evolving requirements. If you're energized by solving technical problems without a playbook and comfortable wearing multiple hats, this role is for you! To clarify, you will

not

be responsible for training ML models and neither would we describe this role as ‘product analytics’.

This role is based in San Francisco, CA. We use a hybrid work model of 3 days in the office per week and offer relocation assistance to new employees.

In this role, you will:
Understand the data needs of Finance teams, including Revenue, Tax, Procurement, Compute & Infrastructure Accounting, Strategic Finance, and translate that scope into technical requirements

Facilitate the development of data products and tools to for stakeholders to self-service and enable analytics to scale across the company

Lead dimensional design - define, own, and maintain business facing data marts

Be a cross-functional champion at upholding high data integrity standards and SLAs for the timely delivery of data

Build and maintain insightful and reliable dashboards to track both operational and financial Metrics for the Executive team

Contribute to the future roadmap of the Finance team from a data systems perspective

Grow to be an expert in Finance Data and OpenAI’s data architecture

You might thrive in this role if you have:
7+ years of experience as an Analytics Engineer or in a similar role (Data Analyst or Data Engineer) with a proven track record in shipping canonical datasets

Empathy towards non-developer stakeholders and their day-to-day pain points

Strong proficiency in SQL for data transformation, comfort in at least one functional/OOP language such as Python or R

Familiarity with managing distributed data stores (e.g. S3, Trino, Hive, Spark), and experience building multi-step ETL jobs coupled with orchestrating workflows (e.g. Airflow, Dagster)

Experience in writing unit tests to validate data products and version control (e.g. GitHub, Stash)

Expert at creating compelling data visualizations with dashboarding tools (e.g. Tableau, Looker or similar)

Excellent communication skills and ability to present data-driven narratives in both verbal and written form to a non-technical audience

Experience solving ambiguous problem statements in an early stage environment

You could be an especially great fit if you have:
Prior experience leading the development of an internal production tool, serving hundreds of cross-functional customers such as Billing Operations, Deal Desk or Go-to-Market teams

Some frontend experience with React, TypeScript, Retool, Streamlit, or building web apps

Good understanding of Spark and ability to write, debug, and optimize Spark jobs

About Klarity

Klarity (YC S18) is building multimodal AI agents that replace how Fortune 500s understand and transform their operations.

Big companies pay consultants millions to document processes and analyze operations. It takes months and goes stale immediately. We built multimodal AI agents that do it continuously. OpenAI, Google, DoorDash, ServiceNow and many others are using Klarity to replace that entire process.

We shipped GPT-4 document chat within 12 hours of OpenAI’s launch. We believe speed and quality happen together when you’re thoughtful about how you build.

At Klarity, you will thrive if:
• Velocity: You’re seeking a culture of rapid iteration and constant change that turns into lasting impact.
• Agency: You’re seeking a role where you can take initiative and embody ownership.
• Care: You hold yourself to high standards, enjoy close collaboration with others who care deeply and hold themselves to equally high standards.
• Energy: You bring drive and optimism to everything you do. You thrive on finding creative solutions to ambiguous problem statements.

The Role

Generative AI is rapidly commoditizing SQL queries, dashboards, and traditional data analytics. Anyone can write a query now. What AI can’t replace is the judgment to know what questions matter, the instinct to connect a qualitative signal from a customer call to a quantitative pattern in usage data, and the conviction to walk into a room and say “here’s what we should build next, and here’s why.”

We’re looking for a Product Analytics Engineer who transforms how our product team makes decisions. This is not a service function that waits for data requests. You are embedded in the product organization—working side-by-side with our Director of Engineering, Head of Design, and CTO—proactively pushing insights and recommendations that shape what we build and how we iterate.

You operate across the full spectrum of product intelligence: quantitative analysis of user behavior and feature performance, qualitative analysis of customer conversations and feedback using generative AI, and the strategic judgment to synthesize both into clear product recommendations. You don’t provide charts. You provide decisions.

Who You Are

Maps business outcomes to data, not data to dashboards

You start with the product question, not the query. You understand what success looks like for a feature, define the metrics that prove it, instrument the events to capture them, and interpret the results in the context of business outcomes. When someone asks “how is this feature doing?”, you don’t just pull numbers—you tell them what the numbers mean and what to do next.

AI-native analyst who multiplies their reach

You use generative AI tools to do what previously required entire teams. You analyze hundreds of Gong call transcripts to surface recurring pain points. You synthesize NPS feedback, support tickets, and user interviews at scale using LLMs. You treat AI as a force multiplier for qualitative research, not just a SQL copilot.

Proactive, not reactive

You don’t wait for a Jira ticket asking for a chart. You see a drop in activation, dig in before anyone asks, and bring a hypothesis and recommendation to the next planning meeting. You set up alerts, monitoring, and recurring analyses that surface problems and opportunities before the team even knows to look.

Thinks in experiments, not reports

You design and analyze A/B tests, feature experiments, and rollout strategies. You understand statistical significance, but you also know when to trust directional signal over perfect data. You help the product team build conviction through rapid experimentation, not endless analysis cycles.

Bridges qualitative and quantitative fluently

You move seamlessly between analyzing PostHog funnels and reading customer interview transcripts. You can spot when quantitative data contradicts what users say (and vice versa) and synthesize both into a coherent story. The best insights come from triangulating across data types, and you do this instinctively.

Brings energy that elevates the product team

You see messy data and ambiguous signals as puzzles to solve. Your enthusiasm for finding the insight that unlocks a product decision raises the bar for the entire team. You make data-informed decision making feel fast and exciting, not bureaucratic.

What You’ll Do

Own product analytics end-to-end

Define what we should measure for new and existing features. Instrument events in PostHog, write the analyses, interpret results, and deliver clear recommendations to the product team. You’re responsible for the full loop: what to measure → how to capture it → what it means → what to do about it.

Build AI-powered qualitative research capabilities

Use generative AI to analyze Gong call transcripts, customer feedback, support conversations, and user interviews at scale. Surface thematic patterns, emerging pain points, and feature requests that would take weeks to uncover manually. Make qualitative insight as fast as pulling a dashboard.

Proactively drive product decisions

Don’t wait to be asked. Identify the most important open product questions, design the analysis to answer them, and bring recommendations to the Director of Engineering, Head of Design, and CTO. Your work directly shapes what gets built next.

Recommend and build new instrumentation

Continuously evaluate what data we’re capturing and what we’re missing. Propose new event tracking, user properties, and data models that give the product team better visibility into user behavior. You don’t just analyze the data we have—you define the data we need.

Design and run experiments

Partner with product and engineering to design A/B tests, feature flag rollouts, and controlled experiments. Analyze results with rigor but also with speed—help the team learn fast and make decisions confidently.

Synthesize across data sources into product narrative

Combine quantitative product data, qualitative customer signals, market context, and business metrics into coherent product narratives. Produce weekly and ad-hoc analyses that the leadership team actually reads and acts on.

Our Stack

Product Analytics: PostHog (our primary analytics platform—event tracking, funnels, retention, feature flags, session replay)

Backend Database: SQL (PostgreSQL)

Customer Intelligence: Gong (call recordings and transcripts), customer feedback channels

AI Tools: We expect you to aggressively use generative AI (Claude, ChatGPT, etc.) to accelerate qualitative analysis, automate recurring analyses, and build internal AI-powered research workflows

Collaboration: You’ll work embedded in the product org, directly alongside the Director of Engineering, Head of Design, and CTO

About the Team
The Finance Data team is embedded within the CFO Org and is responsible for building internal data products that scale analytics across business teams and drive efficiencies in our daily operations. This team provides technical guidance on high-impact, scalable projects across Finance, and is the subject-matter expert in financial and transactional data that supports our Finance day-to-day operations.
About the Role
As an Analytics Engineer, you will be setting the foundation to scale analytics across our business functions and impart best data practices for a rapidly growing organization. We aspire to build the Finance team of the future.

For this role we need someone who excels in dynamic environments, adapts quickly to changing needs, and confidently navigates ambiguous or evolving requirements. If you're energized by solving technical problems without a playbook and comfortable wearing multiple hats, this role is for you!

• Build and maintain insightful and reliable dashboards to track both operational and financial Metrics for the Executive team
• Contribute to the future roadmap of the Finance team from a data systems perspective
• Grow to be an expert in Finance Data and OpenAI’s data architecture

Requirements
• 7+ years of experience as an Analytics Engineer or in a similar role (Data Analyst or Data Engineer) with a proven track record in shipping canonical datasets
• Empathy towards non-developer stakeholders and their day-to-day pain points
• Strong proficiency in SQL for data transformation, comfort in at least one functional/OOP language such as Python or R

• Experience in writing unit tests to validate data products and version control (e.g. GitHub, Stash)
• Expert at creating compelling data visualizations with dashboarding tools (e.g. Tableau, Looker or similar)

Anthropic’s mission is to create reliable, interpretable, and steerable AI systems. We want AI to be safe and beneficial for our users and for society as a whole. Our team is a quickly growing group of committed researchers, engineers, policy experts, and business leaders working together to build beneficial AI systems.

About the Role

As an Analytics Engineer, you will be an early member of the Data Science & Analytics team building the foundation to scale analytics across our organization. You will collaborate with key stakeholders in Engineering, Product, GTM and other areas to build scalable solutions to transform data into key metrics reporting and insights. You will be responsible for ensuring teams have access to reliable, accurate metrics that can scale with our company’s growth. You will also lead your own projects to enable self-serve insights to help teams make data-driven decisions.
Responsibilities:
• Understand the data needs of stakeholder teams in terms of key data models and reporting, and translate that into technical requirements
• Define, build and manage key data pipelines in dbt that transform raw logs into canonical datasets
• Establish high data integrity standards and SLAs to ensure timely, accurate delivery of data
• Develop insightful and reliable dashboards to track performance of core metrics that will deliver insights to the whole company
• Build foundational data products, dashboards and tools to enable self-serve analytics to scale across the company
• Influence the future roadmap of Product and GTM teams from a data systems perspective
• Become an expert in our organization’s data models and the company's data architecture
You might be a good fit if you have:
• 5+ years of experience as an Analytics Data Engineer or similar Data Science & Analytics roles, preferably partnering with GTM and Product leads to build and report on key company-wide metrics.
• A passion for the company's mission of building helpful, honest, and harmless AI.
• Expertise in building multi-step ETL jobs, building robust data models through tooling like dbt; proficiency with workflow management platforms like Airflow and version control management tools through GitHub.
• Expertise in SQL and Python to transform data into accurate, clean data models.
• Experience building data reporting and dashboarding in visualization tools like Hex to serve multiple cross-functional teams.
• A bias for action and urgency, not letting perfect be the enemy of the effective.
• A “full-stack mindset”, not hesitating to do what it takes to solve a problem end-to-end, even if it requires going outside the original job description.
• Experience building an Analytics Data Engineering (or similar) function at start-ups.
• A strong disposition to thrive in ambiguity, taking initiative to create clarity and forward progress.

The annual compensation range for this role is listed below.

For sales roles, the range provided is the role’s On Target Earnings (""OTE"") range, meaning that the range includes both the sales commissions/sales bonuses target and annual base salary for the role.

Annual Salary:

$275,000—$370,000 USD

Logistics

Education requirements: We require at least a Bachelor's degree in a related field or equivalent experience.
Location-based hybrid policy: Currently, we expect all staff to be in one of our offices at least 25% of the time. However, some roles may require more time in our offices.

Visa sponsorship: We do sponsor visas! However, we aren't able to successfully sponsor visas for every role and every candidate. But if we make you an offer, we will make every reasonable effort to get you a visa, and we retain an immigration lawyer to help with this.

We encourage you to apply even if you do not believe you meet every single qualification. Not all strong candidates will meet every single qualification as listed. Research shows that people who identify as being from underrepresented groups are more prone to experiencing imposter syndrome and doubting the strength of their candidacy, so we urge you not to exclude yourself prematurely and to submit an application if you're interested in this work. We think AI systems like the ones we're building have enormous social and ethical implications. We think this makes representation even more important, and we strive to include a range of diverse perspectives on our team.
Your safety matters to us. To protect yourself from potential scams, remember that Anthropic recruiters only contact you from @anthropic.com email addresses. In some cases, we may partner with vetted recruiting agencies who will identify themselves as working on behalf of Anthropic. Be cautious of emails from other domains. Legitimate Anthropic recruiters will never ask for money, fees, or banking information before your first day. If you're ever unsure about a communication, don't click any links—visit anthropic.com/careers directly for confirmed position openings.
How we're different

We believe that the highest-impact AI research will be big science. At Anthropic we work as a single cohesive team on just a few large-scale research efforts. And we value impact — advancing our long-term goals of steerable, trustworthy AI — rather than work on smaller and more specific puzzles. We view AI research as an empirical science, which has as much in common with physics and biology as with traditional efforts in computer science. We're an extremely collaborative group, and we host frequent research discussions to ensure that we are pursuing the highest-impact work at any given time. As such, we greatly value communication skills.

The easiest way to understand our research directions is to read our recent research. This research continues many of the directions our team worked on prior to Anthropic, including: GPT-3, Circuit-Based Interpretability, Multimodal Neurons, Scaling Laws, AI & Compute, Concrete Problems in AI Safety, and Learning from Human Preferences.

• Implement scheduling, subscriptions, alerts, and thresholds using Strategy Distribution Services to deliver timely insights.
• Manage the full analytics object lifecycle, including development, testing, documentation, and promotion to production using packaging, migration, and change management best practices.
• Optimize performance through SQL and VLDB tuning, intelligent cube design, caching strategies, and proactive troubleshooting of production issues.

• Develop and operate monitoring for Strategy jobs, including cube builds, refreshes, and distributions.
• Create and maintain runbooks for incident response, troubleshooting, and continuous improvement.
• Support data governance by documenting data definitions and lineage, enforcing access controls, and supporting audits and compliance activities.

Special Projects and Platform Leadership
• Lead migration and modernization of legacy reporting to Strategy, ensuring functional parity while improving usability and performance.
• Act as the Strategy subject-matter expert for upgrades and environment changes, coordinating testing, documentation, and stakeholder communications.
• Partner with internal clients, IT, and Financial Systems to deliver effective reporting solutions and develop new BI capabilities aligned with strategic goals.
• Mentor developers and power users, establishing reusable components, standards, and automation (e.g., Strategy SDK/REST API, scripting) to improve productivity.

ABOUT YOU
• 7+ years of experience in data analysis and business intelligence, including 5+ years of enterprise MicroStrategy (Strategy) development.
• Advanced MicroStrategy expertise (Workstation/Developer), including metadata and schema design, metrics/dossiers/reports, security configuration (groups, ACLs, filters), and Distribution Services.
• Strong relational database and expert-level SQL skills, including performance tuning and complex query troubleshooting.
• Hands-on experience with BI SDLC best practices: dev/test/prod promotions, change control, and documentation.
• Exposure to Strategy REST APIs/SDKs, automation, or embedded analytics preferred.
• 3+ years of Tableau development experience (Desktop, Server, or Cloud).
• Familiarity with Power BI and SAP BusinessObjects/Crystal Reports a plus, especially for BI platform migrations.
• Experience with Elite 3E or legal/financial systems strongly preferred.
• Bachelor’s degree in Computer Science, Information Systems, Accounting, Business, or equivalent experience.
• Strong analytical, data modeling, and visualization skills, with the ability to communicate insights to technical and non-technical audiences.

Odos is the most advanced Smart Order Routing protocol in DeFi — aggregating liquidity across 16+ EVM chains to deliver the best execution paths for swaps, bridges, and limit orders. With billions in total volume and millions of unique wallets, we’re expanding our data and analytics capabilities to better understand our users, optimize routing algorithms, and support new products like Protected Swaps, Multi-Token Swaps, and Loyalty Programs.

Role Overview

We are seeking a Data & BI Engineer responsible for the design, reliability, and scalability of Odos’s transaction data pipelines, business intelligence metrics, and Tableau dashboards. This role will bridge on-chain trade data with user and loyalty program analytics, enabling the product, growth, and finance teams to make data-driven decisions.

You will own the transaction database layer and help build a unified analytics view of Odos operations — from trade volume and fee revenue to wallet activity, rewards, and partner performance.

Responsibilities

• Data Infrastructure

• Maintain and scale the Odos transaction and event database (Redis, PostgreSQL, or equivalent).

• Build ETL pipelines from on-chain data sources, APIs, and internal services.

• Ensure data integrity, consistency, and query performance across chains and order types.

• Business Intelligence & Reporting

• Define and track key metrics (e.g., total volume, route count, fee revenue, average slippage, gas savings, wallet activity).

• Develop and maintain Tableau dashboards and automated reporting for the leadership team.

• Collaborate with product and growth teams to design campaign and feature-specific analytics (Protected Swaps, Multi-Token Swaps, etc.).

• Loyalty & User Analytics

• Integrate and analyze loyalty program data — wallet tiers, reward distribution, retention, and ROI.

• Work with marketing and growth teams to attribute traffic and measure referral or loyalty campaigns.

• Cross-Functional Collaboration

• Partner with backend engineers on event schemas and pipeline performance.

• Support finance and ops with data exports for audits, investors, and DAO reporting.

• 3+ years experience in data engineering or BI development (preferably in fintech, crypto, or trading).

• Strong SQL proficiency and familiarity with Redis, PostgreSQL, and time-series data.

• Experience with Tableau (or equivalent BI tool) — data modeling, calculated fields, dashboard automation.

• Proficiency in Python or similar scripting language for ETL and data analysis.

• Familiarity with on-chain data, DEX trade logs, or blockchain analytics tools (e.g., Dune, Flipside, The Graph).

• Understanding of DeFi protocols, swaps, liquidity pools, and wallet behavior.

• Strong communication skills, ability to turn raw data into clear business insights.

Nice to Have

• Experience integrating blockchain indexers or running custom subgraphs.

• Familiarity with The Graph protocol and decentralized data indexing.

• Experience designing metrics for revenue forecasting and incentive programs.",True,,,,Anywhere,,,,,,,https://www.google.com/search?q=jobs&gl=us&hl=en&udm=8#vhid=vt%3D20/docid%3DnBUstkRrcWWLOKyeAAAAAA%3D%3D&vssid=jobs-detail-viewer,,,,,{},,,True,,,,,,"['Python', 'SQL', 'Tableau', 'PostgreSQL', 'Communication', 'Leadership', 'Collaboration', 'Data Analysis']",True,True,True,True,True,,Mid

We created Upside to transform brick-and-mortar commerce. Our technology uses the sophistication of online retail-profit measurement, attribution, and incrementality-to provide users with more value on their everyday purchases and brick-and-mortar businesses with new, profitable customers. We've helped millions of users earn 2 to 3 times more cashback than any other product, and hundreds of thousands of brick-and-mortar businesses earn measurable profit. Billions of dollars in commerce run through the Upside platform every year, and that value goes directly back to our retailer partners, the consumers they serve, and important sustainability initiatives.

About the role:
We're looking for an Analytics Engineer to join the team responsible for Upside's core data platform. You'll play a key role in building trusted data products that serve both internal teams and customer-facing features, while also improving the analytics platform and enabling others to do their best data work.
This is a great opportunity for someone who's confident working with large datasets and complex business logic, thrives in a fast-moving environment, and wants to grow as a technical contributor while collaborating closely with product managers, analysts, data scientists, and engineers across the company.

Here are some ways we have seen analytics engineers drive impact at Upside:
• Design and build complex, scalable data products that support internal analytics and power product features, using tools like dbt, Snowflake, and Dagster.

• Translate ambiguous business needs into structured, trustworthy data assets-owning development end-to-end, from design through deployment and monitoring.

• Contribute to shared platform tooling that improves pipeline orchestration, testing, access control, and observability for both engineers and analysts.

• Evaluate and implement new platform capabilities, such as Semantic Views, Cortex, or SnowML, to improve performance, maintainability, and user experience.

• Support and enable teammates across the org, including onboarding new users, resolving data issues, and documenting patterns and best practices.

• Maintain reliability and data quality through shield support rotations, strong monitoring, alerting, and test coverage.

Why You Should Apply
This role is a good fit for you if:
• You aren't afraid to challenge the status quo when it makes the team and business better. You learn from those around you while utilizing data to advocate for informed change.

• You thrive at the intersection of systems and storytelling, not only building robust solutions but also communicating their purpose, impact and rationale, so teams can experiment, iterate, and act confidently.

• You care about building resilient systems that scale. You bring a mindset of continuous improvement, and know when to invest in observability, automation, or new infrastructure to reduce toil and improve outcomes for the team and end users.

• You believe that pulling quality upstream starts with engineering. You champion best practices, encourage early testing and validation, and work closely with peers to build a culture of quality from the ground up.

Ideal Qualifications
• Have 3+ years of experience working in data or analytics engineering roles, preferably in a modern data stack environment (e.g., Snowflake, dbt, Dagster, Airflow).

• Are fluent in SQL, and comfortable writing performant, modular transformations at scale.

• Have working knowledge of Python, particularly in the context of data orchestration, transformations, and testing.

• Understand tradeoffs between different modeling approaches (e.g., Kimball vs. OBT), and can choose appropriate techniques based on data volume and business needs.

• Can independently communicate technical concepts to both engineers and non-technical stakeholders.

• Think critically about ROI, know when to automate, and understand how to balance long-term quality with short-term delivery.

Preferred Qualifications
• Experience supporting machine learning workflows, such as building features or monitoring model inputs and outputs.

• Familiarity with DevOps practices (e.g., CI/CD for data), data governance, or FinOps (cost-conscious design).

• Experience working in a fast-growing startup environment or on platform-style teams that serve internal customers.

Engineering Culture:
We want our engineers to have the time and support to grow in their craft and contribute meaningfully to impactful technical decisions. Engineers are encouraged to focus deeply on their work, collaborate effectively with team members, and continuously develop their skills. Teams are thoughtfully staffed to create a dynamic and diverse environment that enhances learning and innovation.

Location:
This hybrid role is based in our Austin, Chicago, DC, or NYC office. In-office attendance is required on Monday, Tuesday, and Thursday and may increase based on project-based needs and changes to Upside's in-office policy over time.

Compensation:
The US base salary range for this full-time position is $130,000 - $180,000 + equity + benefits. The final starting pay will be determined based on job-related skills, experience, qualifications, work location, and market conditions. Your recruiter can share more about the specific salary range during the hiring process.

• Have 3+ years of experience working in data or analytics engineering roles, preferably in a modern data stack environment (e.g., Snowflake, dbt, Dagster, Airflow).
• Are fluent in SQL, and comfortable writing performant, modular transformations at scale.
• Have working knowledge of Python, particularly in the context of data orchestration, transformations, and testing.
• Understand tradeoffs between different modeling approaches (e.g., Kimball vs. OBT), and can choose appropriate techniques based on data volume and business needs.
• Can independently communicate technical concepts to both engineers and non-technical stakeholders.
• Think critically about ROI, know when to automate, and understand how to balance long-term quality with short-term delivery.

Preferred Qualifications
• Experience supporting machine learning workflows, such as building features or monitoring model inputs and outputs.
• Familiarity with DevOps practices (e.g., CI/CD for data), data governance, or FinOps (cost-conscious design).
• Experience working in a fast-growing startup environment or on platform-style teams that serve internal customers.

Engineering Culture
We want our engineers to have the time and support to grow in their craft and contribute meaningfully to impactful technical decisions. Engineers are encouraged to focus deeply on their work, collaborate effectively with team members, and continuously develop their skills.

You will tackle the dual challenge of scaling our core systems for the future while pioneering the practical application of Generative AI to create real business differentiation.

You will join a focused, agile team with significant autonomy and a mandate to innovate. If you are a curious, hands-on engineer who thrives on variety and wants to shape how a successful fintech scales its most critical capabilities, this is the opportunity for you.

• Help define patterns and practices for building reliable, observable, and cost-effective GenAI systems in production.

• Build safe and effective sandboxes for developers to experiment with new tools and features.

Why you’re a fit at Avant

• Experience: 5+ years of experience in backend or platform engineering.

• Technical Foundation: Strong backend development skills, experience building and deploying services in a cloud environment like AWS, and a solid understanding of infrastructure concepts. While our stack is Python-heavy, we value engineering principles over specific tool expertise.

• Problem-Solving Mindset: You can operate at multiple levels of abstraction, from high-level system design to hands-on coding. You approach unfamiliar tools and patterns with excitement and a desire to learn.

Business Analyst - McKinsey Transformation
Job ID: 104428

Do you want to work on complex and pressing challenges-the kind that bring together curious, ambitious, and determined leaders who strive to become better every day? If this sounds like you, you've come to the right place.

Your Impact
You will operate as part of an engagement team, typically consisting of a team of 2-5 consultants led by an engagement manager. Together you will drive the day-to-day execution of a transformation effort to help clients achieve new performance highs in their business.

You will apply a proven, methodology-driven approach to large-scale transformation that focuses on execution and capability building. Your client engagements will often span >6 months, and they will generally include three phases: Independent Diligence, Bottom-Up Planning, and Implementation. Within these engagements we ensure Analysts are exposed to multiple areas of the businesses, rotating their responsibilities across the Transformation Office and functional and strategic support areas.

You will work directly with clients - usually on site - and will take ownership of specific workstreams and end-products within the overall transformation program. You will be responsible for delivering the transformation objectives within your workstream, coaching your clients to develop and execute effective improvement plans and role-modeling a mindset of rapid decision-making. Above all, your job will be to mobilize and help clients to achieve change that exceeds their expectations.

More broadly, you will have the opportunity to build on your proven capabilities and leverage a range of influencing styles. You will inspire others, build strong relationships and display high energy and resilience in ambiguous and fast-paced contexts. In a collaborative team setting, you'll work closely with others but will also - after appropriate apprenticeship - be expected to operate autonomously with limited direction to drive progress in your areas of accountability.

You will work as part of McKinsey's global Transformation practice. There will be flexibility in the location of this role across our offices in North America. In the Business Analyst role, you will have the opportunity to work on teams and help organizations across the world - across the private, public, and social sectors - solve some of their most difficult problems and operational challenges. You will work with McKinsey teams comprised of transformation experts, sector/functional specialists, and generalist consultants. You will also work with a variety of individuals at our clients, ranging from the C-Suite to front-line workers.

When you join McKinsey, you are joining a firm whose culture is distinctive and inclusive. We will accelerate your development as a leader to create positive, enduring change in the world.

McKinsey's Transformation practice helps clients change their trajectory and achieve their full potential through holistic interventions in performance, capabilities and organizational health. Our suite of transformation approaches is underpinned by distinctive tools and technologies and led by transformation specialists who partner with client teams to enable real, sustained change. We hire experienced professionals from industry, private equity, and the restructuring and professional services ecosystem to work side-by-side with our firm's network of industry and functional experts in large-scale transformation programs around the world.

Your Growth
Driving lasting impact and building long-term capabilities with our clients is not easy work. You are the kind of person who thrives in a high performance/high reward culture - doing hard things, picking yourself up when you stumble, and having the resilience to try another way forward.

In return for your drive, determination, and curiosity, we'll provide the resources, mentorship, and opportunities you need to become a stronger leader faster than you ever thought possible. Your colleagues-at all levels-will invest deeply in your development, just as much as they invest in delivering exceptional results for clients. Every day, you'll receive apprenticeship, coaching, and exposure that will accelerate your growth in ways you won't find anywhere else.

When you join us, you will have:
• Continuous learning: Our learning and apprenticeship culture, backed by structured programs, is all about helping you grow while creating an environment where feedback is clear, actionable, and focused on your development. The real magic happens when you take the input from others to heart and embrace the fast-paced learning experience, owning your journey.
• A voice that matters: From day one, we value your ideas and contributions. You'll make a tangible impact by offering innovative ideas and practical solutions, all while upholding our unwavering commitment to ethics and integrity. We not only encourage diverse perspectives, but they are critical in driving us toward the best possible outcomes.
• Global community: With colleagues across 65+ countries and over 100 different nationalities, our firm's diversity fuels creativity and helps us come up with the best solutions for our clients. Plus, you'll have the opportunity to learn from exceptional colleagues with diverse backgrounds and experiences.
• World-class benefits: On top of a competitive salary (based on your location, experience, and skills), we provide a comprehensive benefits package to enable holistic well-being for you and your family.

Your qualifications and skills
• Bachelor's degree
• 3+ years of corporate and/or professional services experience focused on operations, finance/accounting, and or go-to-market/top-line growth initiatives
• Experience in management consulting, large-scale change management, turnaround and restructurings, M&A and integrations, and or investment banking is a plus
• Program management experience on driving large-scale, transformational change programs is preferred
• Experience in the following is ideal: implementing rapid and successful operational turnarounds and or rapid growth programs across key strategic, revenue, cost and working capital levers, business planning or P&L modeling, working capital management, or 13-week cashflow preparation
• Ability to understand, analyze and interpret financial statements
• Demonstrated aptitude for analytical and conceptual problem solving, comfort with quantitative analysis and managerial accounting
• Ability to work effectively with people at all levels in an organization
• Ability to understand the perspectives of varied stakeholder groups
• Ability to communicate complex ideas effectively, both verbally and in writing

UTR Planning Tech builds the data infrastructure that powers labor planning across 12 Amazon last-mile and sort-center business lines. Our pipelines feed the planning systems that determine how Amazon staffs its delivery network, serving hundreds of sites and processing millions of data points daily.
Our team is shifting from hand-coded, custom pipelines to an AI-native approach. We are building reusable frameworks where engineers and business users define what they need through configurations and natural language instead of writing custom code for every use case. AI agents handle orchestration, validation, and deployment. We are early in this transformation, which means you will not inherit a finished system. You will help define how we build, what patterns we standardize, and how AI fits into data engineering workflows. If you want to learn fast and have a hand in shaping the way a team works, this is that opportunity.
We are hiring a Data Engineer to own significant portions of our data architecture, drive the design of AI-powered frameworks, and deliver data solutions that directly impact planning accuracy across Amazon's delivery network.

• Build AI agent tooling and MCP-based interfaces that allow conversational agents to generate SQL, validate configurations, manage data quality rules, and execute pipeline operations through natural language.
• Own ongoing data quality for datasets you build. Implement standardized data contracts, define SLAs, establish data certification processes, and automate manual quality processes.
• Work with planning scientists, software engineers, BI engineers, and product managers to balance customer requirements with technical requirements. Help shape what we build, not just how.
• Improve self-service access to data. Build analytical data models and tooling that reduce dependency on the DE team for common data access patterns.
• Improve engineering processes: automate manual operations, establish monitoring and alerting standards, and drive code quality and dependency management practices.
• Mentor engineers and interns. Train new team members on how team data solutions are constructed, how they operate, and how they fit into the broader architecture.
• Participate in the interview process and help recruit for the team.

We are seeking a Software Engineer specializing in Data to contribute to the development of the cloud-native data platform for Schwab Asset Management (SAM). We are looking for a code-first engineer, not just a tool operator—who treats data infrastructure as software. This role is ideal for a professional with deep experience in programmatic data engineering who is ready to design scalable architectures with minimal supervision. You will be integral to building robust data services and pipelines on Snowflake and Google Cloud. This is an exciting opportunity to work in a dynamic environment where you will write production-grade code to drive the evolution and optimization of our data ecosystem.

What you have

Core Engineering & Architecture:
• 3-5 years of experience architecting and building cloud-native data platforms (GCP preferred) with a focus on writing clean, maintainable infrastructure-as-code.
• Strong proficiency in Python (or Java/Scala) with a track record of building production-grade data applications, not just scripts.

Data Systems:
• Deep experience modeling and optimizing data for cloud warehouses (Snowflake, BigQuery) using modern design patterns (Star Schema, Data Vault).
• Hands-on expertise with distributed processing frameworks (Apache Spark, Beam, or Flink) and orchestration tools (Airflow/Composer).

DevOps & CI/CD:
• Solid understanding of the full software development lifecycle, utilizing CI/CD pipelines (GitHub Actions, Bamboo, Jenkins) and containerization (Docker, Kubernetes).

Database Versatility:
• Working knowledge of both RDBMS and NoSQL technologies (MongoDB, BigTable, DynamoDB) and when to apply them.

Professional Traits:
• Strong technical communication skills with an ability to translate complex data problems into scalable software solutions.
• Self-starter mentality with the ability to prioritize tasks and deliver results with minimal supervision.

Required Qualifications:
• Education: Bachelor’s degree in Computer Science, Engineering, or equivalent practical experience in software development.
• Experience: 3+ years of experience engineering cloud-native data platforms, with a focus on backend development and data architecture (vs. just analytics).
• Infrastructure as Code: Proven ability to manage infrastructure programmatically.

Preferred Qualifications & Attributes:
• Financial Domain: Prior experience in financial services, specifically with asset management concepts like NAV, Total Returns, or Fair Value calculations.
• Data Governance: Experience implementing automated data quality checks, technical governance, and lineage within pipelines (treating data quality as code).
• Engineering Mindset: A strong critical thinker who approaches data issues with a software engineering lens—root cause analysis, unit testing, and scalable design patterns.
• Communication: Ability to abstract complex technical details when speaking with business stakeholders, while documenting architectural decisions clearly for the engineering team.
• Autonomy: A true self-starter who identifies gaps in the platform and takes the initiative to fix them without waiting for a ticket.

In addition to the salary range, this role is also eligible for bonus or incentive opportunities

What’s in it for you

At Schwab, you’re empowered to shape your future. We champion your growth through meaningful work, continuous learning, and a culture of trust and collaboration—so you can build the skills to make a lasting impact.

JOB SUMMARY

Under the direction of Joint Tech's Vice President of Data Insights and Innovation, the Director of Data Engineering and Integration Services is responsible for the architecture, development, operation, and governance of Central Health System's healthcare data platforms, including the Snowflake cloud data environment, core data architecture, and all data engineering and integration services. This role also provides leadership and oversight for legacy and transitional platforms, including Microsoft SQL Server, as the organization continues its multi-year migration from on-premises and hybrid SQL Server environments to Snowflake. The Director supports business, operational, financial, clinical, and population health use cases across this evolving data ecosystem.

This role requires a hands-on technical leader with deep experience in healthcare data engineering, cloud-native architectures on Microsoft Azure, and interoperability standards including FHIR, as well as strong working knowledge of Microsoft SQL Server in enterprise healthcare environments. The Director leads the design and delivery of scalable, secure, and reliable data ingestion, transformation, and integration pipelines across Electronic Health Records (EHRs), claims systems, financial platforms, and external partners, including pipelines that span SQL Server–based source systems and the Snowflake cloud platform. The Director ensures data is appropriately modeled, curated, and governed during and after migration to support analytics, reporting, data science, and operational workflows.

The Director provides strategic and operational leadership for the Data Engineering and Integration Services function, ensuring that enterprise data platforms and architectures are coherent, resilient, performant, interoperable, and aligned with governance and security standards across both legacy and cloud-native environments.

COMPETITIVE PACKAGE + EQUITY

About the job

We're emerging from stealth. We're building an industrial data foundry — sensor connectivity, real-time data pipelines, and AI for the systems that actually run manufacturing, energy, and critical infrastructure.

We're hiring our first backend and data infrastructure engineer. You'll own the data layer end to end — pipelines, ETL, edge connectivity, security, infrastructure. Founder-level responsibility from day one.

You will work alongside engineers and leaders from ABB, Siemens, Palantir. Autonomous driving engineers from Audi and Volvo. Researchers from Harvard and MIT.

What you've done
• Built heavy data pipelines and ETL systems in production — terabytes of streaming and batch data, strict requirements on correctness, latency, and time alignment
• Worked with messy real-world data sources: industrial sensors, time series, video, audio, LiDAR, geospatial — not just clean relational tables
• Owned infrastructure and DevOps at a startup. CI/CD, IaC, containers, keeping production running. You were the person on call
• Done hands-on security engineering. Threat modeling, secrets management, network segmentation, compliance — not as a checklist but because the systems you built required it
• Been an early hire or first engineer somewhere and built something from scratch that went to production and stayed there
• What you'll own
• Data pipeline architecture from edge sensors through ingestion, transformation, fusion, and delivery into analytics and AI workloads — including multimodal sources like video, audio, and LiDAR alongside traditional telemetry
• ETL tooling with versioning, orchestration, and data quality enforcement so new sources can be onboarded without rebuilding from scratch every time
• Streaming and real-time infrastructure including event-driven systems, edge-to-cloud sync, offline buffering, and latency guarantees set by operational physics
• All DevOps: CI/CD, IaC, container orchestration, edge deployment, cloud GPU provisioning
• Security across the stack: hardening, access control, secrets, scanning, audit logging, and compliance for systems that run mission-critical industrial operations
• Observability and production ops for a distributed system spanning cloud, edge, and enterprise integrations

Who you are
• Strong across data engineering, DevOps, and security — you've actually done all three, not just listed them on a resume
• Experienced with Kafka, Spark, Flink, Airflow, dbt, or equivalent and pragmatic about tool selection
• Comfortable with data that doesn't come in neat rows — sensor streams, point clouds, video, time series
• Think about security as part of system design, not something you add later
• Care about data quality, schema discipline, and pipeline reliability because you've been burned when those things slip
• Want to own something fully and build it right. Not looking for a job — looking for the thing you pour yourself into for the next several years

Today, 60 million Americans living in rural communities are facing a crisis of access to care. In the U.S. healthcare system, rural Americans experience significantly poorer clinical outcomes. This trend is rapidly accelerating as rural hospitals close and physician shortages increase, exacerbating health disparities. In fact, Americans living in rural communities suffer a mortality rate 23 percent higher than those in urban communities, in part because of the lack of access to quality care.
Our vision is care that enables everyone to achieve their best health. So, we’re creating a new healthcare delivery model that is purpose-built for rural America and directly addresses the issues that have historically limited access and quality. Homeward supports Medicare-eligible beneficiaries by partnering with health plans, providers, and communities to align incentives – taking full financial accountability for clinical outcomes and the total cost of care across rural counties.
As a public benefit corporation and Certified B Corp™, Homeward’s mission and business model are aligned to address the healthcare, economic, and demographic challenges that make it challenging for rural Americans to stay healthy. Our Homeward Navigation™ platform uses advanced analytics to connect members to the right care and local resources that address social determinants of health and improve holistic health outcomes. Since many rural communities lack adequate clinical capacity, Homeward also employs care teams that supplement local practices and reach people who cannot otherwise access care.
Homeward is co-founded by a leadership team that defined and delivered Livongo’s products, and backed most recently by a $50 million series B co-led by Arch Ventures and Human Capital, with participation from General Catalyst for a total of $70 million in funding. With this leadership team and funding, Homeward is committed to bringing high-quality healthcare to rural communities in need.

The Opportunity:

Join us in revolutionizing healthcare for rural America!

About the Team

As a Senior+ Agentic Analytics Engineer at Opendoor, you will join the Data organization and help build something that doesn't exist at most companies: an Agentic Analytics team. This is a high-impact IC role at the intersection of data science, data engineering, and AI.

Opendoor has adopted a ""Default to AI"" philosophy—if AI can handle it, AI should handle it. We're not theorizing about AI transformation; we're shipping it.

Why This Role

Most analytics teams are stuck in reactive mode—fielding ad-hoc requests and building dashboards that go stale. We're building something different: AI systems that proactively tell leaders what they should focus on, why it matters, and what to do about it.

If you want to define what analytics looks like in an AI-first company, this is it.

What You'll Do

Build Proactive Intelligence Systems

• Design and deploy AI agents that monitor business performance and surface actionable insights without being asked

• Architect systems that shift analytics from ""answering questions"" to ""anticipating needs""

• Create intelligent alerting that distinguishes signal from noise and recommends specific actions

Create AI-Powered Analytics Tools

• Develop natural language interfaces that let business leaders query data conversationally

• Build semantic layers that translate business concepts into data structures optimized for LLM reasoning

• Ship internal tools that transform how Opendoor makes decisions at every level

Own the Analytics-to-Action Pipeline

• Design data models that support automated analysis, pattern detection, and AI agent interactions

• Build workflows that connect insight generation to recommended actions

• Establish feedback loops that make our AI systems smarter over time

Drive Leverage Across the Business

• Identify high-value opportunities where AI can augment human decision-making

• Implement end-to-end solutions using Claude, custom agents, and modern AI tooling

• Measure impact rigorously—we care about decisions influenced, not dashboards built

We're Looking for Teammates Who Have

Technical Foundation

• 5+ years of experience in analytics, data science, or data engineering, with increasing scope and ownership

• Expert-level SQL with demonstrated ability to design complex data models and optimize for both human and AI consumption

• Strong Python proficiency for data engineering, automation, and AI agent development

• Experience with modern data warehouses (Snowflake, BigQuery, or similar) and the broader data stack (dbt, Airflow, etc.)

AI & Automation Expertise

• Hands-on experience building and deploying AI agents or LLM-powered applications in production

• Deep understanding of LLM capabilities, limitations, and prompt engineering best practices

• Experience architecting semantic layers or natural language interfaces for data access

• Proven ability to identify high-ROI automation opportunities and ship end-to-end solutions

Analytics & Business Acumen

• Track record of driving measurable business impact through analytics—not just producing analyses, but influencing decisions

• Strong analytical intuition—you know what questions matter before they're asked

• Experience translating ambiguous, cross-functional business problems into technical solutions

• History of operating autonomously and setting direction, not just executing on defined projects

Leadership & Influence

• Experience mentoring other analysts or engineers, formally or informally

• Demonstrated ability to influence senior stakeholders and drive alignment across teams

• Comfort operating in ambiguity and shaping strategy, not just responding to it

• Track record of building systems and processes that scale beyond yourself

Builder Mindset

• You ship products, not just dashboards

• You'd rather build something useful in a week than something perfect in a quarter

• You measure success by business impact, not technical complexity

• You're energized by creating leverage—building once so others benefit forever

Bonus Points If You Have

• Experience in real estate, fintech, or marketplace businesses

• Background in marketing analytics, sales operations, product analytics, or pricing/economics

• History of building tools or platforms that replaced recurring analyst work

• Experience leading technical projects or small teams

The base pay range for this position based on level is $186,000 - $256,000 annually, plus RSUs and bonuses. Pay within this range varies by work location and may also depend on your qualifications, job-related knowledge, skills, and experience. We also offer a comprehensive package of benefits including unlimited PTO, medical/dental/vision insurance, life insurance, and 401(k) to eligible employees.
#LI-RO

At Opendoor our mission is to tilt the world in favor of homeowners and those who aim to become one. Homeownership matters. It's how people build wealth, stability, and community.

This is a hybrid position that has the minimum expectation to work out of our Downtown Seattle Office two days per week on Mondays and Thursdays. For this reason, candidates must be based in the Greater Seattle Area or willing to relocate.

Who we're looking for:

We are seeking a Business Analyst on the Finance Analytics team that will be the go-to person for financial metric decomposition and narration, ultimately directly influencing business outcomes and strategic priorities.

This position requires a professional in data storytelling: we are looking for someone who is capable of presenting trends and overarching narratives of business performance to the broader organization, including senior leadership.

As a Business Analyst, you will also partner with Accounting, Tax and Product to maintain current reporting on various areas of the business, and are also encouraged to identify opportunities to improve reporting to better meet the teams’ needs.

• Regularly present to senior leadership and the finance organization on the trends and insights into changes in the business. This includes the decomposition of the drivers of those changes as well as recommendations on actions to improve marketplace performance.
• Provide leverage for the finance, accounting, and tax teams through insights, narratives and increased automation/simplification. Be a thought partner for business owners, getting to the question behind the question and distilling the underlying need to analyze data.
• Demonstrate flexibility and a collaborative mindset by stepping in to support teammates and cross-functional partners as needed.

Your Qualifications:
• 3+ years business experience in Analytics.
• Familiarly with finance and accounting principles, including financial statements.
• Background in data-informed decision-making and partnering with multi-functional teams.
• Track record of strong written and verbal communication to construct clear data narratives to technical and non-technical stakeholders, including senior leadership.
• Fluent with SQL and data visualization tools (e.g. Tableau, Looker, etc.) to independently conduct root cause analyses.
• Experience working with data infrastructure / engineering teams to build and optimize data models.

Nice to have:
• Experience in a two-sided marketplace.
• Familiarity with Python, R, or a similar computational language.

Benefits of working for Rover:
• Competitive compensation
• 401k match
• Flexible PTO
• Competitive benefits package, including medical, dental, and vision insurance
• Commuter benefits
• Bring your dog to work (and unlimited puppy time)
• Doggy benefits, including $1000 toward adopting your first dog
• Stocked fridges, coffee, soda, and lots of treats (for humans and dogs) and free catered lunches semi-monthly
• Regular team activities performed in-person and virtually

Compensation:
• In the greater Seattle area the first-year salary range is $83,931-108,167. Additionally, Rover offers a long-term incentive plan with a company performance-based cash payout and benefits to full-time employees.
• The cash compensation offered for this role will be dependent on the candidate's experience, qualifications, skills, and abilities as demonstrated in the interview and hiring process.

Want to make an impact? Join our pack and come work (and play!) with us.

We believe everyone deserves the unconditional love of a pet—and at Rover, our mission is to make it easier to experience that love. Founded in 2011, the Rover app and website connect dog and cat parents with loving pet sitters and dog walkers in neighborhoods across the US, Canada, and Europe. We empower our community of trusted pet sitters and dog walkers to run their own pet care businesses on Rover with the tools and security of a global company to back them.

Headquartered in Seattle, Washington, we work closely with our teams in Barcelona, San Antonio, Spokane, and remote locations. We’ve got a reputation for being a great place to work, having been named among the 100 Best Companies to Work For in Seattle Business Magazine and Washington’s Best Workplaces in the Puget Sound Business Journal. We're an agile, fast-growing company, and our leadership comes from some of the world's most respected tech companies.

At Rover, our furry coworkers are just as important as our human ones—and we wouldn’t have it any other way. Along with making the joys of pet parenthood more accessible, we’re committed to fostering a diverse, inclusive, and welcoming community of pet people—and that starts with our employees.

This is a Hybrid role, in office Monday and Thursday in our Seattle HQ

Who we're looking for:

We are seeking a Business Analyst to partner closely with Rover’s Trust and Safety Leadership team, driving initiatives that make Rover a safer community for pet parents and sitters. This is a high-visibility role where you will collaborate directly with a diverse set of stakeholders to define, measure, and improve the success of the T&S program. You will be responsible for conducting in-depth analysis of new and developing business trends, which includes proactively identifying issues and then developing and proposing actionable solutions. Another key component of this position will be ownership of analytics support and strategy for Rover’s account safety and fraud mitigation program. This role requires a unique skillset: the ideal candidate must be comfortable translating ambiguous business problems into crisp requirements, and then using those to build creative data products that meet niche business needs.

Your Responsibilities:
• Strategic Planning & Measurement: Partner with Trust and Safety leadership to define the strategy for measuring program health and operational performance, including establishing comprehensive metrics, developing crisp reporting, and setting up monitoring rhythms.
• Performance Analysis: Conduct in-depth analysis of key Trust and Safety operational metrics to identify emerging trends and opportunities, which will inform deeper research and analytical efforts.
• Executive Communication: Develop and present crisp narratives resulting from analytics findings and investigations to senior Operations leaders, focusing on both identified problems and proposed solutions.
• Fraud Mitigation: Collaborate with Account Safety leadership to measure program performance and proactively identify and mitigate fraud trends on the Rover platform.
• Thought Partnership: Serve as a strategic partner and advisor to business leaders, making data-driven recommendations on investments and optimization strategies within Trust and Safety.
• Data Infrastructure Support: Support the construction and maintenance of our core reporting abstractions (built in dbt).

Your Qualifications:
• At least 4 years experience working cross-functionally with complex datasets to support organizational decision making.
• Excellent verbal and written communication skills. Specifically, you know how to narrate analysis and results to business partners in a useful, concise, and meaningful way.
• You are extremely comfortable with receiving stakeholder questions and independently translating them into clear, actionable analytical problems to solve, all with relative autonomy.
• You have hands-on experience building out data abstractions using tools such as DBT or Airflow as well as a variety of data visualization tools (e.g., Mode, Looker, Periscope, Tableau, etc.)
• Strong proficiency with SQL. You would feel confident reviewing code produced by other analysts and data scientists

Nice to Have:
• Masters degree in a quantitative field OR on the job experience with applied statistics.
• Ability to code in Python/R is a plus
• Hands-on experience working with customer service tool data sets (e.g., Zendesk)
• Hands-on experience running A/B tests and experiment design

Benefits:
• Competitive compensation
• 401k
• Flexible PTO
• Competitive benefits package, including medical, dental, and vision insurance
• Commuter benefits
• Bring your dog to work (and unlimited puppy time)
• Doggy benefits, including $1000 toward adopting your first dog
• Stocked fridges, coffee, soda, and lots of treats (for humans and dogs) and free catered lunches semi-monthly
• Regular team activities performed in person and virtually

Compensation:
• In the greater Seattle area the first year salary range is $108,694 -$136,046. Additionally, Rover offers a long-term incentive plan with a company performance-based cash payout and benefits to full-time employees.
• The cash compensation offered for this role will be dependent on the candidate's experience, qualifications, skills and abilities as demonstrated in the interview and hiring process.

At Rover, we’re driven by seeing our people succeed and grow, while doing our jobs better than ever before. We believe the best business outcomes come from a diverse set of perspectives and we’re committed to promoting an inclusive, inventive, and fun environment with amazing employees. We welcome and encourage applicants from all backgrounds to apply.

How We're Different

We believe that the highest-impact AI research will be big science. At Anthropic we work as a single cohesive team on just a few large-scale research efforts. And we value impact — advancing our long-term goals of steerable, trustworthy AI — rather than work on smaller and more specific puzzles. We view AI research as an empirical science, which has as much in common with physics and biology as with traditional efforts in computer science. We're an extremely collaborative group, and we host frequent research discussions to ensure that we are pursuing the highest-impact work at any given time. As such, we greatly value communication skills.

The easiest way to understand our research directions is to read our recent research. This research continues many of the directions our team worked on prior to Anthropic, including: GPT-3, Circuit-Based Interpretability, Multimodal Neurons, Scaling Laws, AI & Compute, Concrete Problems in AI Safety, and Learning from Human Preferences.

The Connected Warfare division builds software and hardware to connect every robot, human, and sensor in every domain. We are dedicated to creating a truly connected battlefield, leveraging AI, autonomous systems, and advanced networking to provide warfighters with the intelligence and agility needed to win in any environment.

The first party team within Connected Warfare provides relevant Connected Warfare capabilities for every Anduril solution. Every mission, capability and domain increasingly relies on being connected, powered and enabled through networked technology and we consist of a growing cross-functional team supporting every part of Anduril and partnering on some of Anduril's most important opportunities.
ABOUT THE JOB

This role has two primary responsibilities:
• Improving and Managing First Party Operations: The first party teams works across almost every division and functional organization at Anduril. You will work with many teams to improve processes that define and support first party growth and sustainment. You will build out data-capture and analytics-reporting muscles to drive positive change over the long term as well as create and manage critical processes for the team.
• Executing Special Projects: The first party team is frequently pulled into high-priority initiatives impacting many Anduril teams that must be solved, but do not fall neatly into the purview of an existing person's job description. Examples include data pulls across multiple teams as well as managing last minute product deliveries. We're looking for someone able and willing to get tapped when a messy problem needs solving.
WHAT YOU'LL DO:
• Own operational projects end-to-end, from definition, to solutioning, to implementation, to sustainment. You will be handed ambiguous problems with little prescription on how to solve them. If this does not excite you, this is not the role for you.
• Our teams work on problems that sit at the intersection of people, hardware and software systems including:
• Inventory management systems
• Asset-tracking
• Manufacturing and supply chain systems capturing data on quality-issues on the production floor.
• Pipeline tracking and sales systems
• Work on strategic problems, providing structure to ambiguity and helping shepherd cross-functional groups of stakeholders towards decisions on strategic issues. The role will ask you to couple first principles thinking with creative and iterative analysis to fully detail the impacts of potential decisions.
• Work deeply within data and systems, become intimately familiar with how our systems function, and leverage data from them to execute scrappy analyses on short timelines, all the while equipping teams with insights and tools to measure and improve their processes.
• Project manage across large groups of stakeholders including leading large meetings, managing large Slack channels, and wrangling stakeholders towards a solution. This role requires the ability to translate across Supply Chain, Manufacturing, Finance, Engineering, HR, Recruiting, Growth, Deployments, and more.
• Foster cross-business line collaboration to make all of Anduril work better together. Develop and maintain strong working relationships with internal stakeholders, including senior leadership, while ensuring trust, clear communication, and goal alignment across groups; effectively represent product capabilities to internal customers as necessary.
WHAT WE'RE LOOKING FOR

Ownership Mentality. We're looking for owners: those who have a natural bias to assume responsibility, a healthy dose of skepticism, and contribute to a culture of performance. We empower our team to quickly assume high levels of responsibility and entrust them to actively own their account and shape its success.

Structured Thinker and Problem Solver. This role requires clear communication and well thought-out plans. We are looking for assertive communicators who bring a thoughtful perspective and honest dialogue. A solution-driven approach, the ability to distill complexity into its essential, digestible components, and the ability to execute are critical to ensure mission success.

High Value Team Member. Do you enjoy working as part of a team? At Anduril, the path to success weaves through the organization - account teams, engineering, logistics, technical operations, and more. It requires humility, an eagerness to learn, and empathy toward your fellow team member. We assume best intentions and empathize with customers just as we do with our colleagues. We are a low ego group that promotes teamwork and collaboration to bring about success.

Adaptability to Unstructured Environments. We work a dynamic, ever-changing environment and are looking for individuals who can confidently navigate ambiguity. You excel at quickly structuring ambiguous situations and translating unstructured challenges into clear, actionable strategies that drive mission success.

REQUIRED QUALIFICATIONS:
• You have 3+ years of experience in an internal strategy, operations, business analyst, management consulting, or similar role.
• You have stood up complex processes from scratch and managed them end to end.
• You are self-driven and relentlessly proactive. You don't need someone to tell you to ""move"". You just move. We'd rather have to tell you to slow down than to speed up.
• You don't wait on others to solve problems. You proactively step into the gap to offer solutions yourself.
• You lean into acknowledging your weaknesses and take the idea of feedback and growth seriously.
• You have built clear frameworks and processes to structure and solve problems.
• You have strong analytical aptitude. You intuitively think about problems in terms of numbers and data-models, and you are able to quickly execute analyses in Excel.
• You are comfortable communicating broadly and having a lot of eyes on your work. This role can at-times require comms to large groups and senior leadership. This should excite you!
• Must be a U.S. Person due to required access to U.S. export controlled information or facilities.
• Eligible to obtain and maintain an active U.S. security clearance.
PREFERRED QUALIFICATIONS
• Ability to work within organizations with minimal structure and with minimal direction.
• Proven track record in designing and implementing best practices that drive operational efficiency and sustainable growth.",False,6 days ago,1771459200.0,2026-02-19T00:00:00.000Z,"Seattle, WA",Seattle,Washington,US,47.6061389,-122.3328481,,https://www.google.com/search?q=jobs&gl=us&hl=en&udm=8#vhid=vt%3D20/docid%3DCZV4uNlnp1aIQrK0AAAAAA%3D%3D&vssid=jobs-detail-viewer,,,,,"{'Qualifications': [""We're looking for someone able and willing to get tapped when a messy problem needs solving"", ""We're looking for owners: those who have a natural bias to assume responsibility, a healthy dose of skepticism, and contribute to a culture of performance"", 'This role requires clear communication and well thought-out plans', 'We are looking for assertive communicators who bring a thoughtful perspective and honest dialogue', 'A solution-driven approach, the ability to distill complexity into its essential, digestible components, and the ability to execute are critical to ensure mission success', 'High Value Team Member', 'It requires humility, an eagerness to learn, and empathy toward your fellow team member', 'We work a dynamic, ever-changing environment and are looking for individuals who can confidently navigate ambiguity', 'You excel at quickly structuring ambiguous situations and translating unstructured challenges into clear, actionable strategies that drive mission success', 'You have 3+ years of experience in an internal strategy, operations, business analyst, management consulting, or similar role', 'You have stood up complex processes from scratch and managed them end to end', 'You are self-driven and relentlessly proactive', 'You don\'t need someone to tell you to ""move""', 'You have built clear frameworks and processes to structure and solve problems', 'You have strong analytical aptitude', 'You intuitively think about problems in terms of numbers and data-models, and you are able to quickly execute analyses in Excel', 'You are comfortable communicating broadly and having a lot of eyes on your work', 'This role can at-times require comms to large groups and senior leadership', 'Must be a U.S. Person due to required access to U.S. export controlled information or facilities', 'Eligible to obtain and maintain an active U.S. security clearance'], 'Benefits': [""You don't wait on others to solve problems""], 'Responsibilities': ['Improving and Managing First Party Operations: The first party teams works across almost every division and functional organization at Anduril', 'You will work with many teams to improve processes that define and support first party growth and sustainment', 'You will build out data-capture and analytics-reporting muscles to drive positive change over the long term as well as create and manage critical processes for the team', ""Executing Special Projects: The first party team is frequently pulled into high-priority initiatives impacting many Anduril teams that must be solved, but do not fall neatly into the purview of an existing person's job description"", 'Examples include data pulls across multiple teams as well as managing last minute product deliveries', 'Own operational projects end-to-end, from definition, to solutioning, to implementation, to sustainment', 'You will be handed ambiguous problems with little prescription on how to solve them', 'Our teams work on problems that sit at the intersection of people, hardware and software systems including:', 'Inventory management systems', 'Manufacturing and supply chain systems capturing data on quality-issues on the production floor', 'Pipeline tracking and sales systems', 'Work on strategic problems, providing structure to ambiguity and helping shepherd cross-functional groups of stakeholders towards decisions on strategic issues', 'The role will ask you to couple first principles thinking with creative and iterative analysis to fully detail the impacts of potential decisions', 'Work deeply within data and systems, become intimately familiar with how our systems function, and leverage data from them to execute scrappy analyses on short timelines, all the while equipping teams with insights and tools to measure and improve their processes', 'Project manage across large groups of stakeholders including leading large meetings, managing large Slack channels, and wrangling stakeholders towards a solution', 'This role requires the ability to translate across Supply Chain, Manufacturing, Finance, Engineering, HR, Recruiting, Growth, Deployments, and more', 'Foster cross-business line collaboration to make all of Anduril work better together', 'Develop and maintain strong working relationships with internal stakeholders, including senior leadership, while ensuring trust, clear communication, and goal alignment across groups;

Work Where It’s Best for You

Work Anywhere means you can work in an office or at home on any given day. It’s about getting the work done in the way and place that works best for each person. This applies across all locations and departments.

Work Anywhere does not mean work at any time. We have predictable core hours where employees are generally available for meetings and collaboration. Employees are focused and available during core hours.

We invest in our offices to make them places where our employees like to go. If you work in the office three or more days a week, you will have a dedicated office workspace. Our offices function as hubs to draw people in, create social bonds, and where random connections and mixing of ideas happen. We’re investing more in offices, culture, and offsite meetings, not less.

Product teams are organized in regional product hubs for optimal collaboration and live within a time zone of their hub. Our current product hubs are located in Pleasanton, Columbus, Boston, Kansas City, New York City, Raleigh, and Toronto. We create opportunities for teams to get together in person regularly.

Customer-facing roles, such as Sales and Professional Services, live near and/or travel to their customers.

When an employee moves within a country it does not cause a change in salary. Where you live impacts you and your family. Not knowing if your compensation will change if you move can cause stress and uncertainty for everyone. We wanted to eliminate that.

About the team and role

Data is at the heart of every decision made at Klaviyo, and we're looking for a Business Intelligence Data Engineer to join our Business Intelligence (BI) team supporting People Analytics. This domain of data aims to improve the experience of all Klaviyos, from culture and engagement to retention and satisfaction. This role sits in Data Engineering as part of the BI team and is fully dedicated to People Analytics as a sponsored headcount.

You'll build and steward the source of truth for people data so People leaders and analysts can answer lifecycle questions quickly and confidently and turn those insights into a healthier, higher-performing organization.

You will be an independent, embedded partner to People leadership, capable of translating ambiguous requirements into stable data products. You'll be supported by the broader Data Engineering organization's standards, tooling, and review practices.

How you'll make a difference

• Deliver people‑data SSoT that drives employee experience. Stand up curated, documented marts that make it easy to monitor org health, retention, hiring, performance, movement, and comp cycles so that leadership can act earlier and more precisely.

• Own the pipelines & models end‑to‑end. Build and maintain reliable integrations from core HR systems (e.g., HRIS/ATS/OKR/comp), model them in dbt, and publish governed marts and reverse‑ETLs to operational destinations where they create value.

• Create lifecycle views with People Analytics. Partner with analysts to build hireonboarddeveloppromotecompensateoffboard lifecycle views and ""employee 360"" profiles that reduce swivel‑chair reporting and speed up decision cycles.

• Raise the bar on data reliability and governance. Instrument monitoring and alerting, tests (freshness/volume/constraints), and documentation so the people data ecosystem is discoverable, auditable, and self-serve.

• Operate as a trusted partner to leadership. Work directly with People leadership to scope problems, clarify trade‑offs, and communicate technical concepts in exec‑ready language.

What you'll do (responsibilities)

• Integrations & ingestion: Own secure ingestion from HRIS/ATS/comp/performance systems into Snowflake; define SLAs/SLOs; implement monitoring & alerting for each feed.

• Modeling & marts: Design dimensional/entity models (dbt) for employees, positions, org structure, requisitions/offers, performance/promo history, compensation/equity, and movement; publish curated marts with strong contracts and lineage.

• Reverse ETL: Operationalize high‑value models to downstream tools and workflows using reverse‑ETL patterns to close the loop between insight and action.

• Quality & governance: Implement tests (unit/integration, schema/freshness), data policies (masking, purpose‑based access), and documentation that enable safe self‑service across the analytics community.

• Repository stewardship: Maintain the analytics codebase (dbt repo), perform code reviews, and ensure modular, reusable patterns the broader team can adopt.

• Stakeholder partnership: Run an intake & engagement model with People Analytics (primary), HRIS/People Tech (security/integration), Finance (plan/comp interfaces), and BI/Platform teams (shared standards).

Who you are (qualifications)

Must‑have

• 3–5+ years in analytics/data engineering with production ELT in Snowflake + dbt + SQL; Python for orchestration/utilities.

• Demonstrated independence partnering with senior, non‑technical leaders; able to translate open‑ended needs into scalable data products.

• Proven experience implementing tests, monitoring, and documentation that keep pipelines healthy and reporting trustworthy.

• Experience building data integrations and reverse‑ETL pipelines that support business operations.

• Airflow (orchestration) and Fivetran/Workato (ELT/integration).

• Familiarity with data privacy controls (masking/RLS) in people data.

• AWS experience (S3/EC2/Lambda) and IaC/Terraform.

• You've already experimented with AI in work or personal projects, and you're excited to dive in and learn fast. You're hungry to responsibly explore new AI tools and workflows, finding ways to make your work smarter and more efficient.

The tools you'll use

Snowflake, dbt, Airflow, Fivetran, Workato, Python, AWS, Tableau/Looker/ThoughtSpot; publishing via reverse‑ETL where appropriate.

Success measures & ramp plan (30/60/90)

• 30 days: Access/RBAC in place; landscape documented; agree with People leadership on the first lifecycle views and SSoT scope; monitoring baselines defined.

• 60 days: Core HRIS ingestion + tests/alerts live; first curated marts (headcount/movement, recruiting funnel) powering People Analytics dashboards; reverse‑ETL pilot to an operational destination.

• 90 days: Extend coverage (e.g., performance, compensation); publish employee 360 profile model; codify governance/RLS for sensitive attributes; usage dashboard for self‑serve adoption.

What this role is not

• Not a Workday configuration/HR
IS admin role.

• Not an infra‑only platform role. This is hands‑on modeling + ELT + reverse‑ETL in service of People Analytics.

• Contribute to and uphold a shared KPI dictionary, data lineage map, and self-service analytics framework.

• Ensure ongoing compliance with data security, privacy, and governance requirements.

Innovation & Enablement

• Enable data-driven decision-making across CS by building infrastructure that supports self-service analytics and operational automation.

• Collaborate with analytics and data science pods to enable predictive insights (e.g., contact reduction, customer pain propensity, satisfaction scoring).

• Lead innovation through AI-driven analytical methods including classification, NLP, and propensity modeling.

• Identify and implement emerging technologies that improve data accuracy and usability.

• Partner with CS teams to evolve real-time triggers and proactive customer engagement frameworks & tooling.

What We’re Looking For

Required Qualifications

• 10+ years of experience in data engineering, data platform architecture, or data infrastructure, with at least 3+ years in a leadership role.

• Proven track record in operating in cloud-based data ecosystems in complex, matrixed environments.

• Demonstrated business acumen, with a bias toward iterative delivery, measurable impact, and value creation.

• Strong expertise with modern data platforms (e.g., Snowflake, BigQuery, Redshift, Databricks, Delta Lake) and orchestration frameworks (e.g., Airflow, dbt).

• Hands-on experience with programming and data languages (SQL, Python, Scala, or Java).

• Demonstrated ability to align technical strategies with business outcomes and lead cross-functional stakeholder collaboration.

• Experience managing and mentoring engineering teams, with a focus on performance, reliability, and scalability.

• Excellent communication and influencing skills, particularly across business and technical stakeholders.

• Expertise in real-time data streaming (Kafka, Kinesis, or Pub/Sub).

• Experience building data governance frameworks and integrating with enterprise data management functions.

• Strong understanding of financial data alignment, especially in collaboration with FP&A or Finance teams.

Success in This Role

• CS data is accurate, accessible, and aligned with Finance and BTT standards.

• Unified CS data model enables faster, more confident insights and decision-making.

• Time-to-insight for key metrics and dashboards improves quarter over quarter.

• High-performing, autonomous data engineering team delivering reliable pipelines and proactive solutions.

• Strong partnership and governance with Finance and BTT, operating as a “federated” data organization.

We have a strong preference for process-oriented systems thinkers who excel in balancing stakeholder requirements, technical debt, and organizational complexity-and whothrive in environments where they need to create structure from ambiguity. You'll need to be comfortable making principled decisions, taking ownership not just of code but of outcomes, and operating with significant autonomy as we build the platform together.
ABOUT THE ROLE

In this role, you will:
• Be an end-to-end owner of our data platform infrastructure, ensuring its security, usability, and performance. Work closely with analytics engineers, machine learning engineers, and software engineers to ensure the platform meets their needs.
• Make collaborative decisions about data tooling, pipeline design, and governance, and implement opinionated interfaces that facilitate easy and best-practice-aligned development for other teammates.
• Continuously improve failure rates for data sources by moving alerting ""to the left""; i.e. catching and quarantining bugs/failures as close to the source as possible.
• Analyze patterns in how source data is generated, modeled, and consumed. Work with stakeholders to implement the best solution when new data sources are added.
• Take ownership of existing tools and workflows that may be functional but lack formal structure, documentation, or reliability measures. You'll assess what's working, identify gaps, and systematically improve systems to production-grade quality.
• Document everything you build knowing that you're creating the foundation others will build upon. Your runbooks, architecture decision records, and system documentation will become the institutional knowledge of our data platform.
• Proactively communicate with multiple stakeholders on platform capabilities, technical constraints, architectural decisions, project priorities, and platform support.
• Confidently juggle multiple projects and priorities in our fast-paced environment and work with stakeholders and platform teammates to ensure infrastructure changes, migrations, and improvements are delivered on schedule.
• Automate aggressively and deliberately; anything from GitHub Actions to Slack Workflows to minimize repetitive tasks. Effectively judge when the level of effort is appropriate and avoid over-engineering.

ABOUT YOU
• You have 6+ years of experience working with data infrastructure, data engineering, or platform engineering within a fast-paced environment. You are highly proficient with SQL, Python, and cloud-based Infrastructure-as-Code (e.g. Terraform), and comfortable working with bash/shell scripting.
• You have 4+ years of production experience with modern data stacks including data warehouses (BigQuery, Snowflake, or Redshift), orchestration tools, managed ingestion services, and infrastructure as code (Terraform, Pulumi, or CloudFormation).
• You have 2+ years of experience building and maintaining production data pipelines, whether through ELT tools, custom applications, streaming systems, or event-driven architectures.
• You've successfully ""professionalized"" data infrastructure before-taking scrappy, working systems and evolving them into reliable, well-documented, production-grade platforms. You can articulate what ""production-ready"" means in a data context.
• You have a bias toward action and aren't paralyzed by imperfect solutions. You understand when ""good enough for now with a plan to improve"" beats ""perfect but six months late."" You ship incrementally and iterate based on feedback.
• You're comfortable being the first person to tackle a problem. You don't need extensive mentorship or detailed tickets-you can take a high-level business need and figure out the technical approach. That said, you know when to ask for help and can articulate what you need.
• You take ownership seriously-not just of writing code, but of outcomes. When you build something, you implement monitoring, write runbooks, create alerts, and ensure it can be maintained by others. You think about the full lifecycle of systems, not just initial delivery.
• You have strong opinions, weakly held. You can make and defend architectural decisions, but you're open to feedback and willing to change course when presented with better information. You can disagree and commit.
• You understand that ""building from scratch"" doesn't mean rejecting existing tools-it means thoughtfully selecting, configuring, and integrating managed services and open-source solutions to create a cohesive platform. You know when to build and when to buy.
• You have experience making big changes to critical data infrastructure. You've successfully re-architected, migrated, or upgraded data tooling that has strict SLA's, without significantly affecting downstream stakeholders.

Bonus points if:
• You have led a data infrastructure migration or modernization project where you defined the vision, approach, and implementation.
• You have created internal tools, frameworks, or CLIs that improved how teams work with data (not just one-off scripts).
• You have established data platform best practices like CI/CD workflows, testing frameworks, or observability standards where none existed.
• Expertise in cloud platforms and technologies analogous to our stack:
• Our stack: GCP (BigQuery, Datastream, Cloud Functions, Vertex AI, GCS), dbt, Fivetran, Postgres, Python, Terraform, Looker, Retool
• Analogous experience: AWS (Redshift, DMS, Lambda, SageMaker, S3) or Azure (Synapse, Data Factory, Functions), Snowflake, Airbyte/Stitch, infrastructure as code tools, BI platforms

• 5+ years of Business Analyst experience, with lead or standalone BA responsibilities
• Strong experience using Smartsheet
• Background in hospitality (hotels, resorts, restaurants, travel, or related)
• Experience working in small or mid-sized organizations (not solely enterprise environments)
• Comfortable operating with limited tooling, systems, and structure
• Proven ability to build processes, frameworks, and documentation from scratch
• Strong stakeholder management and communication skills

Salary Range: The salary for this position is between $100,000 - $130,000 annually. Factors which may affect pay within this range may include geography/market, skill, education, experience, and other qualifications of the successful candidate.

Benefits: The Company offers the following benefits for this position, subject to applicable eligibility requirements: [medical insurance] [dental insurance] [vision insurance] [401(k) retirement plan] [long-term disability insurance] [short-term disability insurance] [5 personal day accrued each calendar year.

Inclusion & Diversity

We believe our commitment to diversity and inclusion creates a work environment filled with exceptional individuals. We're thrilled to have been recognized for our efforts through the Human Rights Campaign Corporate Equality Index, Dave Thomas Adoption Friendly Advocate, and several Seramount lists, including the Inclusion Index, 100 Best Companies for Working Parents, Best Companies for Dads, and Top 75 Companies for Executive Women.

To foster a culture of inclusivity throughout our workforce, workplace, and marketplace, Transamerica offers a wide range of diversity and inclusion programs. This includes our company-sponsored, employee-driven Employee Resource Groups (ERGs), which are formed around a shared interest or a common characteristic of diversity. ERGs are open to all employees. They provide a supportive environment to help us better appreciate our similarities and differences and understand how they benefit us all.

Giving Back

We believe our responsibilities extend beyond our corporate walls. That's why we created the Aegon Transamerica Foundation in 1994. Through a mix of financial grants and the volunteer efforts of our employees, the foundation supports nonprofit organizations focused on the things that matter most to our people in the communities where we live and work.

Transamerica's Parent Company

Aegon acquired the Transamerica business in 1999. Since its start in 1844, Aegon has grown into an international company serving more than 23.9 million people across the globe.* It offers investment, protection, and retirement solutions, always with a clear purpose: Helping people live their best lives. As a leading global investor and employer, the company seeks to have a positive impact by addressing critical environmental and societal issues, with a focus on climate change and inclusion and diversity.

Backed by $450M from leading investors including Altimeter Capital, Redpoint Ventures, T. Rowe Price, Lightspeed Venture Partners, Alpine Space Ventures, and others – with an additional $500M in signed contracts across commercial and US government customers – we're mass-producing the highest-power satellite platforms ever built for missions from LEO to deep space.

The rise of heavy-lift launch vehicles is shifting the industry from an era of mass constraint to one of mass abundance, and we believe this new era demands a fundamentally different class of spacecraft. Engineered to survive the harshest radiation environments and to fully capitalize on today's and tomorrow's massive rockets, K2 satellites deliver unmatched capability at constellation scale and across multiple orbits.

With multiple launches planned through 2026 and 2027, we're Building Bigger to develop the solar system and become a Kardashev Type II (K2) civilization. If you are a motivated individual who thrives in a fast-paced environment and you're excited about contributing to the success of a groundbreaking Series C space startup, we'd love for you to apply.

The Role

Quality isn't just about compliance—it's about building systems that help teams execute with clarity and speed. We're looking for someone who can design and manage the procedures that govern how our business runs from design handoffs to production checks, supplier engagement, and continuous improvement. If you love mapping complex processes, making them simple and repeatable, and embedding them into tools people actually use, this role is for you.

Responsibilities
• Design and implement clear, efficient, and repeatable procedures for requirement flow across the organization.
• Build templates, checklists, and automated steps integrated into PLM/MES and design tools to embed quality into workflows.
• Simplify requirement interpretation and document generation using modern tools
• Define and maintain practical production quality procedures (work instructions, inspection plans, process capability checks) embedded in execution systems.
• Create feedback loops for production/design teams to suggest and implement improvements quickly.
• Develop scalable supplier onboarding, audit, and risk management procedures; integrate quality data (APQP/PPAP, SCARs) into dashboards for fast action.
• Build analytics and dashboards to measure process effectiveness (e.g., NCR cycle time, CoPQ trends, audit findings) and maintain real-time visibility.
• Stand up data pipelines with automation to reduce manual steps and improve accuracy.
• Lead QMS certification, audits, and coordinate business system-related improvement efforts.

Qualifications
• BA/BS in Business Systems, Engineering, Industrial Engineering, or related field
• 7+ years driving QMS and business process improvements independently
• Proven experience creating and managing QMS procedures for high-reliability industries (aerospace, automotive, medical devices, robotics, electronics manufacturing, etc.)
• Strong understanding of AS9100 and AS9145/APQP (or similar frameworks) and ability to make them practical and lightweight
• Hands-on experience with data tools: SQL, AWS, or similar; BI dashboards (Tableau, Power BI, Office365 Suite, PowerApps)

Nice to Have
• Experience with automation for document generation, compliance checks, and workflow integration
• Familiarity with GIDEP/DLA resources and supplier quality systems
• Startup experience: building lean processes from scratch and scaling them as the company grows
• Able to obtain a security clearance if required

Compensation and Benefits:
• Base salary range for this role is $130,000 - $170,000 + equity in the company
• Salary will be based on several factors including, but not limited to: knowledge and skills, education, and experience level
• Comprehensive benefits package including paid time off, medical/dental/vision coverage, life insurance, paid parental leave, and many other perks

If you don't meet 100% of the preferred skills and experience, we encourage you to still apply! Building a spacecraft unlike any other requires a team unlike any other and non-traditional career twists and turns are encouraged!

If you need a reasonable accommodation as part of your application for employment or interviews with us, please let us know.

Export Compliance

As defined in the ITAR, ""U.S. Persons"" include U.S. citizens, lawful permanent residents (i.e., Green Card holders), and certain protected individuals (e.g., refugees/asylees, American Samoans). Please consult with a knowledgeable advisor if you are unsure whether you are a ""U.S. Person.""

The person hired for this role will have access to information and items controlled by U.S. export control regulations, including the export control regulations outlined in the International Traffic in Arms Regulation (ITAR). The person hired for this role must therefore either be a ""U.S. person"" as defined by 22 C.F.R. § 120.15 or otherwise eligible for a federally issued export control license.
